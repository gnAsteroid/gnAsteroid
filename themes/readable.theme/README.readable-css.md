# readable.css

readable.css is a CSS framework, but not like the others you've seen. Rather than helping you build a sitewide design, readable.css provides a base default that is both sensible and beautiful. Out of the box features include:

- Light and dark mode (manually or via `prefers-color-scheme`)
	- High contrast support (manually or `prefers-contrast: high`)
- Responsive design
- Vertical rhythm
- Headers, footers, and navigation bars
- Beautiful images, blockquotes, asides, tables, and forms
- Text justification (off by default)
- Native font support (serif, sans-serif, or monospace)

Features you will intentionally _not_ find:

- Flashy animations
- Custom fonts
- Utility classes
- Anything that overrides your users' browser settings

The key design principle of readable.css is **consistency**. Colors, font-style, border widths, line heights, and everything else are consistent through the entire site.
