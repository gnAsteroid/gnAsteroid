this branch was a POC to use stackeditjs,

so on our example/ home page,

the view template added a [edit] button
    <button 
        onclick="stackedit.openFile({
            name: 'home', 
            content: document.getElementById('home').innerHTML
        })">Edit</button>

But POC does not work because of Firefox error:

Request to access cookie or storage on
“https://stackedit.io/app#origin=http%3A%2F%2F127.0.0.1%3A8888&fileName=home&contentText=&contentProperties=&silent=”
was blocked because we are blocking all third-party storage access requests and
content blocking is enabled.

See https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Privacy/Storage_Access_Policy/Errors/CookieBlockedForeign

Since the page uses an iframe to a 3rd party i/o showing
side to side markdown/rendered text, i figure this POC
is NOT WHAT WE WANT anyway. -> trash ∎
