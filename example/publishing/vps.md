## VPS, own server

This means you have a server (or a VPS, which is a cheap alternative).

*PROS:*

* easiest, most flexible if you're a techie,
* no need to embed the asteroid or the style => auto-refresh,
* can use rsync or any kind of mechanism from local to server,

We won't provide explanation for now, as it's mostly the same as launching locally, except it's on a server.
