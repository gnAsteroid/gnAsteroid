## Akash

**Akash** is a decentralized cloud platform similar to Vercel or AWS built on Cosmos. Prototypes of asteroids have already been deployed on Akash in the past. It requires understanding Akash, and Dockerfile though.

The example can be found at https://github.com/grepsuzette/gnAsteroid.docker.

*PROS*:

* no need for a machine, VPS or domain name,
* decentralized, just need crypto (AKT).

*CONS*:

* it's quite hard,
* the offers of the providers are not very stable, it's not shot and forget for now.
