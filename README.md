Asteroids are simple websites or personal wikis that can interact with the Realms on the [GNO blockchain](https://github.com/gnolang/gno). 

You can use it to setup personal blogs, organisation websites, presenting newly discovered gems in the gnoland or just as experimental playgrounds. Imagine a wiki structure using markdown that can also render smart contracts (realms) from the https://gno.land blockchain, with redactional and stylistic autonomy.

gnAsteroid is built on the [gnoweb package](https://github.com/gnolang/gno/tree/master/gno.land/pkg/gnoweb) from [gno.land](https://gno.land). It doesn't intend to compete with it, since it's plugged onto the same realms but asteroids are made to gravitate around gno.land using the same idea.

When files in an asteroid are modified, they are automatically refreshed on the server.

# Minimal example

* **Compile** using `go build -o gnAsteroid` (or `make`)
* **Run** with `./gnAsteroid -asteroid-dir=example`, 
* **Visit** with a browser.

# To create a GNO asteroid

1. install gnAsteroid: `git clone https://github.com/gno/gnAsteroid`
2. Create an asteroid, let's say we're bob:

```
mkdir -p ~/asteroids/bob/
cd ~/asteroids
echo "Hello the Gnosmos! This is [Bob](about)'s blog :)" > bob/index.md
echo "I'm Bob from Neptune. In a previous life I was a sumo." > bob/about.md
```

That's it, we've created an asteroid with 2 pages.
Launch essentially like before:
```bash
gnAsteroid \
    -bind 127.0.0.1:8888 \
    -asteroid-name "Bob's asteroid" \
    -asteroid-dir ~/asteroids/bob
```
Test by visiting [http://127.0.0.1:8888](http://127.0.0.1:8888).

Tip: instead of specifying the name, you may type it in a file `.TITLE` at the root of your asteroid.

# Styling an asteroid?

Asteroids are very rough rocks.

In the context of asteroids, we call **style** a set 
of 3 folders: `css`, `font` and `img`. You may fork and
modify the style at [grepsuzette/gnAsteroid.style-gnosmos](https://github.com/grepsuzette/gnAsteroid.style-gnosmos).

Then `gnAsteroid -style-dir=/path/to/your/style -asteroid-dir=example`

When no style is specified, a style similar to gnosmos, embedded 
within the binary, is used.

# TODO

- [ ] publish realm to register asteroid belts
- [ ] query asteroid belts to show links
- [ ] some kind of publication system
- [ ] better `<table>` styling

# More 

More links may arrive soon, e.g.:

* gnAsteroid.style-gnosmos: a simple style you can use and modify.
* gnAsteroid.docker: a docker system to serve asteroids (especially on Akash)
